## Features

- Load PDF notes and extract text automatically.  
- Split notes into chunks for efficient retrieval.  
- Convert chunks into embeddings using **HuggingFace embeddings**.  
- Store embeddings in **FAISS** for fast similarity search.  
- Use **Flan-T5 LLM** to generate answers based on retrieved chunks.  
- Command-line chat interface for interactive Q&A.
